ViewSets with SimpleJWT Integration

In this project, viewsets from Django REST Framework are used to manage API endpoints efficiently. SimpleJWT handles authentication through JWT tokens, ensuring secure access to the API. Viewsets streamline the handling of CRUD operations by combining them into a single class, with JWT authentication enforcing security and permissions.
